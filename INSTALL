* Installing a haskell compiler

To install you need a recent haskell compiler.
The easiest way is to install the haskell platform.
If you are on ubuntu/debian-linux, simply open a terminal and type
>sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
otherwise see http://www.haskell.org/platform

Note, this is only tested on linux, but should work 
on windows/mac/etc. If not please let me know.

* Installing the wcc-program (or any other haskell-program...)

When you have the haskell platform installed,
unpack the wcc program either graphically (on windows download 7-Zip or similar), or if on linux just type
>tar -zxf wcc-X-X.tgz
where X-X is the version number.
enter the directory
>cd wcc-X-X
and install.
>cabal install

To be able to just type
>wcc
in any directory, the place where wcc is installed need to be in
your $PATH environment.
on linux it is .cabal/bin.
To add it too you $PATH environment in ubuntu/debian, type
>echo "PATH=\"\$HOME/.cabal/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.profile
and re-login.

Or install it globally (for all users, requires root-permissions) typing
>sudo cabal install --global
instead of cabal install
